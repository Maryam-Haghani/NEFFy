/**
 * @file msaWriter.h
 * @brief This file contains the declaration of the MSAWriter class and its derived classes.
 *
 * The MSAWriter class provides functionality to write multiple sequence alignments (MSA) to different file formats.
 * It supports writing MSAs in a2m, a3m, stockholm, fasta, clustal, pfam and aln formats.
 * 
 * The MSAWriter class is an abstract base class, and the derived classes provide specific implementations for each format.
