\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_m_s_a_writer}{MSAWriter} class and its derived classes. 

The \doxylink{class_m_s_a_writer}{MSAWriter} class provides functionality to write multiple sequence alignments (MSA) to different file formats. It supports writing MSAs in a2m, a3m, stockholm, fasta, clustal, pfam and aln formats. The \doxylink{class_m_s_a_writer}{MSAWriter} class is an abstract base class, and the derived classes provide specific implementations for each format.
