\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_multimer_handler}{Multimer\+Handler} class to manage and manipulate MSA of a multimer. 


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Verify if the MSA is in the format of the given stoichiometry, When multimer is a heteromer(with more than one distinct chain), MSA starts from paired\+MSA, followed by the MSA of the chains in the multimer. When multimer is a homomer, MSA is a concatenation of MSAs of the chain.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The implementation includes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Constructor to initialize the split position.
\item Method to verify the structure of the MSA with the given stochiometry.
\item Method to return the MSA sets. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
