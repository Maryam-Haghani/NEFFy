\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_m_s_a_splitter}{MSASplitter} class to manage and manipulate MSAs. 

The \doxylink{class_m_s_a_splitter}{MSASplitter} class provides methods to\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Verify if the MSA is in a paired form, where sequences are followed by the MSA of the first monomer, followed by the MSA of the second monomer.
\item Split the MSA into three sets\+: paired MSA, MSA of the first monomer, and MSA of the second monomer.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The implementation includes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Constructor to initialize the split position.
\item Method to verify the structure of the MSA.
\item Method to return the split sets.
\item Private helper functions to determine set membership and extract non-\/zero parts of the MSA rows. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
