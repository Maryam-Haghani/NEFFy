/**
 * @file msaSplitter.h
 * @brief This file contains the declaration of the MSASplitter class to manage and manipulate MSAs.
 * 
 * The MSASplitter class provides methods to:
 * - Verify if the MSA is in a paired form, where sequences are followed by the MSA of the first monomer, followed by the MSA of the second monomer.
 * - Split the MSA into three sets: paired MSA, MSA of the first monomer, and MSA of the second monomer.
 * 
 * The class includes:
 * - A constructor to initialize the split position.
 * - Methods to verify the structure of the MSA and return the split sets.
 * - Private helper functions to determine set membership and extract non-zero parts of the MSA rows.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * Create an instance of MSASplitter with the desired split position, then use its methods to process and retrieve MSA sets.
